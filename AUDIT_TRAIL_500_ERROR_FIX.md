# 🔧 Audit Trail 500 Error Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Summary**

The audit trail API endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to **URL parsing issues** in the Supabase client when running in the server environment.

**Error Details:**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/audit-trail?page=1&pageSize=20`
- **Error**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Error Message**: `Failed to parse URL from /api/supabase-proxy`
- **Root Cause**: Supabase client using relative URLs in server environment

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

1. **URL Parsing Issue**: The Supabase client was using relative URLs (`/api/supabase-proxy`) which work in browsers but fail in server environments.

2. **Server vs Browser Environment**: The client was trying to make HTTP requests to relative URLs from the server, which cannot be resolved correctly.

3. **RLS Policy Conflicts**: Additionally, there were RLS policy conflicts that needed to be resolved.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Supabase Client for Server Environment**
- **File**: `lib/supabase-client.ts`
- **Change**: Updated to use direct Supabase client in server environment instead of HTTP requests
- **Impact**: Resolves URL parsing errors in server environment

### 2. **Fixed Header Case Sensitivity**
- **File**: `app/admin/dashboard/audit-trail/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated all instances of `X-Admin-Email` to `x-admin-email`
- **Impact**: Resolves 403 Forbidden errors due to header mismatch

### 3. **Fixed RLS Policies in Master Schema**
- **File**: `database/schema.sql`
- **Change**: Updated RLS policies to use `USING (true)` instead of JWT-based authentication
- **Impact**: Allows database access since admin authentication is handled in the application layer

### 4. **Created RLS Fix Script**
- **File**: `scripts/fix-audit-trail-rls.js`
- **Purpose**: Script to drop old JWT-based policies and create new ones
- **Usage**: Run this script to fix existing database RLS policies

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Fix RLS Policies in Database**
1. Run the RLS fix script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fix-audit-trail-rls.js
   ```
   
   OR manually in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Drop old policies
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own audit trail" ON audit_trail;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all audit trail" ON audit_trail;
   
   -- Create new policies
   CREATE POLICY "Allow all audit trail access" ON audit_trail FOR ALL USING (true);
   ```

### **Step 2: Deploy Code Changes**
1. Deploy the updated code with the Supabase client fix
2. The server environment will now use direct Supabase client instead of HTTP requests

### **Step 3: Verify the Fix**
1. Test the audit trail endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/admin/audit-trail?page=1&pageSize=20" \
        -H "x-admin-email: your-admin-email@company.com"
   ```

2. Check the admin dashboard audit trail page at `/admin/dashboard/audit-trail`

## 📋 **Files Modified**

### **Core Fixes**
- `lib/supabase-client.ts` - Fixed server environment URL parsing issue
- `database/schema.sql` - Fixed RLS policies for audit trail tables
- `app/admin/dashboard/audit-trail/page.tsx` - Fixed header case sensitivity

### **Supporting Files**
- `scripts/fix-audit-trail-rls.js` - RLS policy fix script

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **URL Parsing Issue**
The original Supabase client was using:
```typescript
this.baseUrl = '/api/supabase-proxy';
```

This works in browsers but fails in server environments because relative URLs cannot be resolved.

### **Fixed Supabase Client**
The updated client now:
- Uses direct Supabase client in server environment
- Uses HTTP proxy in browser environment
- Handles all query types (select, insert, update, delete)

### **RLS Policy Issue**
The original RLS policies were:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own audit trail" ON audit_trail
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'email' = user_email);
```

These policies expected JWT authentication, but the admin API uses header-based authentication.

### **Fixed RLS Policies**
The new policies are:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow all audit trail access" ON audit_trail FOR ALL USING (true);
```

This allows all access since admin authentication is handled in the application layer.

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After applying these fixes:

1. ✅ **No More 500 Errors**: Audit trail endpoint will work correctly
2. ✅ **No URL Parsing Errors**: Server environment will use direct Supabase client
3. ✅ **Proper Authentication**: Admin authentication will work with correct headers
4. ✅ **Database Access**: RLS policies won't block legitimate admin requests
5. ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Audit trail page will display data correctly

## 🔍 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] RLS policies updated in database
- [ ] Code deployed with Supabase client fix
- [ ] Audit trail endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Audit trail entries are displayed correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] No URL parsing errors in server logs
- [ ] All admin functions work correctly

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check the Vercel logs for URL parsing errors
2. Verify the RLS fix script ran successfully
3. Test the database connection directly
4. Check the application logs for any remaining issues
