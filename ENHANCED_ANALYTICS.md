## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
```
app/alignzo/analytics/
â”œâ”€â”€ enhanced-analytics.tsx          # Main enhanced analytics component
â”œâ”€â”€ enhanced/page.tsx               # Enhanced analytics page route
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WorkloadTab.tsx            # Workload & utilization analytics
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectHealthTab.tsx       # Project health & FTE analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ JiraTicketsTab.tsx         # JIRA ticket analytics (future)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ OperationalEfficiencyTab.tsx # KPI analysis (future)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ TeamInsightsTab.tsx        # Team insights (future)
```

### Database Schema
The system leverages the existing database schema with tables:
- `work_logs`: Time tracking data
- `projects`: Project information
- `users`: User details
- `teams`: Team structures
- `jira_project_mappings`: JIRA integration mappings
- `jira_user_mappings`: User mapping for JIRA

### Key Metrics Calculations

#### Utilization Rate
```javascript
utilizationRate = (totalLoggedHours / totalAvailableHours) * 100
```

#### FTE Calculation
```javascript
fte = totalHours / (standardWorkHoursPerDay * workingDaysInPeriod)
```

#### Effort Share
```javascript
effortShare = (projectHours / totalTeamHours) * 100
```

#### Productivity Index
```javascript
productivityIndex = (ticketsResolved * priorityWeight) / hoursLogged
```

## Usage Guide
