# Edit Task Modal Fixes Summary ✅

## 🚨 **Issues Identified**

### **Issue 1: Assigned To Not Prepopulated**
- **Problem**: When the EditTaskModal opens, the "Assigned To" dropdown was not showing the currently assigned user
- **Root Cause**: Team members were loaded asynchronously after form initialization, causing a timing issue where the assigned_to value wasn't properly set in the dropdown

### **Issue 2: Due Date Unexpectedly Updated**
- **Problem**: When updating other fields (like estimated hours), the due date value was getting changed unexpectedly
- **Root Cause**: The useEffect dependency on `task` was causing the form to re-initialize on every task change, and the date formatting was causing timezone conversion issues

## 🔧 **Solutions Applied**

### **Files Fixed**:

1. **`components/kanban/EditTaskModal.tsx`**

### **Fix 1: Assigned To Prepopulation**

**Before (not working)**:
```typescript
// Team members loaded after form initialization
if (teamMembersResponse.data) {
  setTeamMembers(teamMembersResponse.data);
}
```

**After (fixed)**:
```typescript
// Team members loaded and assigned_to properly set
if (teamMembersResponse.data) {
  setTeamMembers(teamMembersResponse.data);
  
  // Ensure assigned_to is properly set if it exists in the task
  if (task.assigned_to && teamMembersResponse.data.some((member: TeamMember) => member.user_email === task.assigned_to)) {
    setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, assigned_to: task.assigned_to }));
  }
}
```

### **Fix 2: Due Date Timezone Issues**

**Before (causing timezone issues)**:
```typescript
// useEffect dependency causing re-initialization
useEffect(() => {
  // ... form initialization
}, [isOpen, task]); // ❌ Re-runs on every task change
```

**After (fixed)**:
```typescript
// useEffect dependency only on task ID
useEffect(() => {
  // ... form initialization
}, [isOpen, task?.id]); // ✅ Only re-runs when task ID changes
```

**Date Formatting Fix**:
```typescript
// Before (manual date formatting)
const formatDateForInput = (dateString: string | null | undefined) => {
  const date = new Date(dateString);
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  // ... manual formatting
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}T${hours}:${minutes}`;
};

// After (proper ISO formatting)
const formatDateForInput = (dateString: string | null | undefined) => {
  const date = new Date(dateString);
  // Use toISOString and slice to get YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm format
  return date.toISOString().slice(0, 16);
};
```

## 📋 **Technical Details**

### **Why These Fixes Were Needed**:

1. **Assigned To Issue**:
   - Team members were loaded asynchronously after form initialization
   - The assigned_to value was set before team members were available
   - The dropdown couldn't match the assigned_to value to any option

2. **Due Date Issue**:
   - useEffect dependency on entire `task` object caused unnecessary re-initialization
   - Manual date formatting was causing timezone conversion issues
   - Every form field change triggered the useEffect, causing date re-formatting

### **Benefits**:
- ✅ Assigned To field now properly prepopulates with current assignment
- ✅ Due date no longer changes unexpectedly when updating other fields
- ✅ Better timezone handling for datetime inputs
- ✅ Improved performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ More stable form state management

## ✅ **Status: RESOLVED**

- ✅ Assigned To prepopulation fixed
- ✅ Due date timezone issues resolved
- ✅ Form stability improved
- ✅ Performance optimized

The EditTaskModal should now properly display the assigned user and maintain stable due date values when editing other fields.
