# JIRA Ticket Search Fix - Enhanced Search Strategies

## Issue Description
In the start timer, add work log modal, and add/edit task modal in the kanban page, the JIRA ticket search was not working properly. The search for ticket `CMPOPS-6873` was returning "No tickets found" even though the ticket exists in JIRA.

## Root Cause
The original JIRA ticket search was using a limited search strategy:

1. **Limited Search Scope**: Only searched in summary and description fields
2. **Missing Ticket Key Search**: Did not search for exact ticket keys (e.g., CMPOPS-6873)
3. **Restrictive Project Filtering**: Required exact project match without fallback options
4. **Single Search Strategy**: Used only one JQL query approach

## Original Search Query
```sql
project = ${projectKey} AND (summary ~ "${searchTerm}" OR description ~ "${searchTerm}")
```

This query would fail to find tickets when:
- Searching for ticket keys (e.g., CMPOPS-6873)
- The project key mapping is slightly different
- The ticket exists but summary/description don't contain the search term

## Enhanced Search Solution
Implemented a multi-strategy search approach in `lib/jira.ts`:

### Strategy 1: Exact Ticket Key Match (Most Specific)
```sql
key = "CMPOPS-6873"
```
- Searches for exact ticket key match
- Most precise search for known ticket IDs
- Bypasses project restrictions

### Strategy 2: Project + Ticket Key Pattern
```sql
project = CMPOPS AND key ~ "CMPOPS-6873"
```
- Searches within specific project for ticket key patterns
- Useful when project mapping is correct

### Strategy 3: Project + Summary/Description (Original)
```sql
project = CMPOPS AND (summary ~ "CMPOPS-6873" OR description ~ "CMPOPS-6873")
```
- Original search strategy as fallback
- Searches within project scope

### Strategy 4: Global Search (Fallback)
```sql
(summary ~ "CMPOPS-6873" OR description ~ "CMPOPS-6873" OR key ~ "CMPOPS-6873")
```
- Searches across all accessible projects
- Useful when project mapping is incorrect
- Ensures tickets are found regardless of project scope

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`lib/jira.ts`** - Enhanced `searchTickets` method with multiple search strategies
2. **`app/api/jira/search-tickets/route.ts`** - Added detailed logging for debugging

### Search Flow
1. **Try Strategy 1**: Exact key match (fastest, most accurate)
2. **Try Strategy 2**: Project + key pattern (project-scoped)
3. **Try Strategy 3**: Project + summary/description (original approach)
4. **Try Strategy 4**: Global search (fallback, most comprehensive)

### Error Handling
- Each strategy is tried independently
- Failures in one strategy don't stop others
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful fallback to next strategy

## Expected Results
After the fix:

✅ **Ticket Key Search**: `CMPOPS-6873` will be found immediately  
✅ **Partial Search**: `6873` will find tickets with that number  
✅ **Project Search**: `CMPOPS` will find all project tickets  
✅ **Summary Search**: Text in summaries will still work  
✅ **Fallback Search**: Tickets in different projects will be found  

## Testing
Created test script `test-jira-ticket-search.js` to verify:
- Exact ticket key search works
- Different search strategies are effective
- API responses are correct
- Error handling works properly

## Benefits
1. **Higher Success Rate**: Multiple search strategies increase findability
2. **Better User Experience**: Users can find tickets with various search terms
3. **Robust Fallback**: Global search ensures tickets aren't missed
4. **Debugging Support**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
5. **Performance**: Fast exact matches for known ticket keys

## Deployment Status
The fix is ready for deployment. The changes:
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Improve search success rate significantly
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include detailed logging for monitoring

## Usage Examples
Users can now search using:
- **Exact Ticket ID**: `CMPOPS-6873` → Immediate result
- **Partial ID**: `6873` → Pattern match results
- **Project Name**: `CMPOPS` → All project tickets
- **Description Text**: `bug fix` → Summary/description matches
