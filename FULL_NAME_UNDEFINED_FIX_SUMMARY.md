# Full Name Undefined Fix Summary ✅

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

**Runtime Error**: JavaScript runtime error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'full_name')
```

**Location**: `page-0eed5880c15310c1.js:1:45597` (minified build)

**Root Cause**: The `EditTaskModal` component was trying to access `member.users.full_name` without checking if `member.users` exists, causing a runtime error when the users object is undefined.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **Files Fixed**:

1. **`components/kanban/EditTaskModal.tsx`**
   - Added optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access `member.users.full_name`
   - Added fallback to `member.user_email` if `full_name` is not available

### **Code Changes**:

**Before (causing runtime error)**:
```typescript
{teamMembers.map((member) => (
  <option key={member.id} value={member.user_email}>
    {member.users.full_name}  // ❌ Error: member.users might be undefined
  </option>
))}
```

**After (fixed)**:
```typescript
{teamMembers.map((member) => (
  <option key={member.id} value={member.user_email}>
    {member.users?.full_name || member.user_email}  // ✅ Safe access with fallback
  </option>
))}
```

## 📋 **Technical Details**

### **Why This Fix Was Needed**:
- The `teamMembers` data structure sometimes has `member.users` as undefined
- The code was trying to access `full_name` property on an undefined object
- This caused a runtime error that crashed the component
- The fix ensures graceful handling of missing user data

### **Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  user_email: string;
  users?: {  // Optional - can be undefined
    full_name: string;
    email: string;
  };
}
```

### **Benefits**:
- ✅ Runtime error fixed
- ✅ Component no longer crashes when user data is missing
- ✅ Graceful fallback to email when full_name is not available
- ✅ Maintains functionality even with incomplete data

## ✅ **Status: RESOLVED**

- ✅ Runtime error fixed
- ✅ Component handles missing user data gracefully
- ✅ Fallback mechanism ensures display always works
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

The application should now run without the "Cannot read properties of undefined" error when displaying team members in the EditTaskModal.
