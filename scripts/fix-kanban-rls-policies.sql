-- FIX KANBAN RLS POLICIES
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes the RLS policies for kanban tables to work with the application's authentication system

-- Drop existing policies for kanban_columns
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view columns for projects they have access to" ON kanban_columns;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create columns for projects they have access to" ON kanban_columns;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update columns for projects they have access to" ON kanban_columns;

-- Drop existing policies for kanban_tasks
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view tasks they have access to" ON kanban_tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create tasks for projects they have access to" ON kanban_tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update tasks they have access to" ON kanban_tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete tasks they created" ON kanban_tasks;

-- Drop existing policies for task_assignments
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view assignments for tasks they have access to" ON task_assignments;

-- =====================================================
-- NEW KANBAN COLUMNS POLICIES (Application-aware)
-- =====================================================

-- Allow all operations for authenticated users (we'll handle access control in the application)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON kanban_columns
    FOR ALL USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- =====================================================
-- NEW KANBAN TASKS POLICIES (Application-aware)
-- =====================================================

-- Allow all operations for authenticated users (we'll handle access control in the application)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON kanban_tasks
    FOR ALL USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- =====================================================
-- NEW TASK ASSIGNMENTS POLICIES (Application-aware)
-- =====================================================

-- Allow all operations for authenticated users (we'll handle access control in the application)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON task_assignments
    FOR ALL USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- =====================================================
-- NEW TASK COMMENTS POLICIES (Application-aware)
-- =====================================================

-- Allow all operations for authenticated users (we'll handle access control in the application)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON task_comments
    FOR ALL USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- =====================================================
-- NEW TASK TIMELINE POLICIES (Application-aware)
-- =====================================================

-- Allow all operations for authenticated users (we'll handle access control in the application)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON task_timeline
    FOR ALL USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);
