# Google Drive Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Added Comprehensive Logging for Debugging

**Problem**: Google Drive API was failing with "No stored tokens found" error without proper debugging information.

**Solution**: Added detailed console logs throughout the Google Drive service:

- **File**: `lib/google-drive.ts`
  - Added logging to `ensureAuthenticated()` method
  - Added logging to `loadStoredTokens()` method  
  - Added logging to `listFiles()` method

- **File**: `app/api/google-drive/files/route.ts`
  - Added comprehensive API logging
  - Enhanced error responses with details

**Log Format**: Uses emoji prefixes for easy identification:
- üîê Authentication logs
- üîç Database query logs
- üìÅ File operation logs
- ‚úÖ Success logs
- ‚ùå Error logs
- üöÄ API request logs

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Admin Google Drive Page Layout

**Problem**: Admin Google Drive page was displaying without the sidebar and header, appearing as a standalone page.

**Solution**: 
- **File**: `app/admin/google-drive/page.tsx`
  - Removed the full-screen wrapper div
  - Removed background styling that was overriding the admin layout
  - Now properly integrates with the admin dashboard layout

### 3. ‚úÖ Added Google Drive Access Control

**Problem**: Google Drive access was not controllable from the admin users page like other features.

**Solution**:

- **File**: `app/admin/dashboard/users/page.tsx`
  - Added `access_google_drive` field to the form data
  - Added checkbox in the user permissions form
  - Updated user editing to include Google Drive access

- **File**: `lib/supabase.ts`
  - Added `access_google_drive?: boolean` to the User interface

- **File**: `app/alignzo/layout.tsx`
  - Updated Google Drive navigation item to use `access_google_drive` instead of `access_dashboard`
  - Now properly respects user access permissions

### 4. ‚úÖ Removed Configuration Gear Button from User Page

**Problem**: Users could see and access a gear button that allowed them to configure Google Drive credentials.

**Solution**:
- **File**: `app/alignzo/google-drive/page.tsx`
  - Removed the Settings gear button from the header
  - Removed the entire configuration panel
  - Removed configuration-related state variables
  - Removed the `saveConfiguration` function
  - Users can no longer modify Google Drive configuration

## Security Improvements

1. **Access Control**: Google Drive is now properly controlled through admin user management
2. **Configuration Security**: Only admins can configure Google Drive credentials
3. **User Separation**: Users cannot access configuration options

## Debugging Enhancements

The new logging system will help identify issues like:
- Missing OAuth tokens
- Database connection problems
- Google API authentication failures
- File operation errors

## Database Schema Update

The `users` table now includes the `access_google_drive` column for proper access control.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin Configuration**: Test the admin Google Drive page loads with proper layout
2. **User Access Control**: Test that users without Google Drive access cannot see the menu item
3. **Configuration Security**: Verify users cannot access configuration options
4. **Logging**: Check server logs for detailed Google Drive operation information

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: Ensure the `access_google_drive` column exists in the users table
2. **Environment Variables**: Verify all Supabase environment variables are set
3. **Google Cloud**: Ensure OAuth credentials are properly configured
4. **Access Control**: Set up initial user permissions for Google Drive access

## Files Modified

1. `lib/google-drive.ts` - Added comprehensive logging
2. `app/api/google-drive/files/route.ts` - Enhanced API logging
3. `app/admin/google-drive/page.tsx` - Fixed layout integration
4. `app/admin/dashboard/users/page.tsx` - Added access control
5. `lib/supabase.ts` - Updated User interface
6. `app/alignzo/layout.tsx` - Updated navigation access control
7. `app/alignzo/google-drive/page.tsx` - Removed configuration options

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes
2. Test the logging system with actual Google Drive operations
3. Configure user access permissions in the admin panel
4. Monitor server logs for any remaining issues
