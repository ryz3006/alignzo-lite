# Remedy Dashboard - Comprehensive Incident Analytics

## Overview

The Remedy Dashboard is a comprehensive analytics solution integrated into the Alignzo Lite application that provides detailed insights into incident management performance. It offers real-time metrics, visualizations, and trend analysis for IT operations teams.

## Features

### 📊 **1. Incident Volume & Trends**
- **Total Incidents**: Real-time count of all incidents within the selected time frame
- **Incidents by Priority**: Distribution breakdown showing critical, high, medium, and low priority incidents
- **Incidents by Region**: Geographical distribution of incidents across different regions
- **Incident Trend Over Time**: Line chart showing incident volume trends over selected period
- **Incidents by Reported Source**: Analysis of how incidents are being reported (phone, email, self-service, etc.)

### ⚡ **2. Performance & Efficiency**
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Average time from incident creation to first response
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: Average time from incident creation to resolution
- **First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate**: Percentage of incidents resolved without transfers
- **Incident Reopen Rate**: Percentage of incidents that were reopened after resolution
- **SLA Compliance Rate**: Percentage of incidents resolved within SLA timeframes

### 👥 **3. Team & Group Performance**
- **Incidents per Assignee**: Workload distribution across team members
- **Resolution Rate by Group**: Success rate of different support groups
- **Average Resolution Time by Group**: Performance comparison across teams
- **Group Transfer Analysis**: Analysis of incident transfers between groups
- **Average Resolution Time by Priority**: Performance metrics broken down by priority levels

### 🏷️ **4. Categorization & Product Analysis**
- **Incidents by Product**: Most problematic products and services
- **Incidents by Operational Category**: Breakdown by operational categories (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- **Incidents by Product Categorization**: Granular product-related issue analysis

### 👤 **5. User & Customer Impact**
- **Incidents by VIP Status**: Special attention to VIP user incidents
- **Incidents by Department**: Department-wise incident distribution
- **Incidents by Impact**: Impact level analysis (High, Medium, Low)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The dashboard utilizes the `uploaded_tickets` table with the following key fields:
- `incident_id`: Unique identifier for each incident
- `priority`: Incident priority level
- `region`: Geographical region
- `reported_date1`: Incident creation date
- `responded_date`: First response date
- `last_resolved_date`: Resolution date
- `status`: Current incident status
- `assignee`: Assigned team member
- `resolver_group`: Group responsible for resolution
- `group_transfers`: Number of transfers between groups
- `reopen_count`: Number of times incident was reopened
- `vip`: VIP status indicator
- `department`: Affected department
- `impact`: Impact level
- `product_name`: Related product
- `operational_category_tier_1/2/3`: Operational categorization

### Key Metrics Calculations

#### Time-based Metrics
```typescript
// MTTR Calculation
const meanTimeToResolve = resolvedTickets.reduce((sum, ticket) => {
  return sum + calculateTimeDiff(ticket.reported_date1, ticket.last_resolved_date);
}, 0) / resolvedTickets.length;

// FCR Rate Calculation
const firstCallResolutionRate = (firstCallResolutionCount / resolvedTickets.length) * 100;
```

#### SLA Compliance
```typescript
// SLA Compliance Rate
const slaComplianceRate = (resolvedTickets.filter(t => {
  const resolutionTime = calculateTimeDiff(t.reported_date1, t.last_resolved_date);
  const priority = t.priority?.toLowerCase() || 'medium';
  const slaHours = priority === 'critical' ? 4 : priority === 'high' ? 8 : priority === 'medium' ? 24 : 48;
  return resolutionTime <= slaHours * 60;
}).length / resolvedTickets.length) * 100;
```

### Filtering System
The dashboard supports comprehensive filtering:
- **Date Range**: Filter incidents by reported date
- **Projects**: Filter by specific projects
- **Users**: Filter by assigned team members
- **Teams**: Filter by team assignments

### Data Export
Users can export dashboard data to CSV format including:
- Summary metrics
- Priority breakdowns
- Regional analysis
- Top assignee performance

## Usage Guide

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/alignzo/analytics`
2. Click on the "Remedy Dashboard" tab
3. Use the global filters to customize your view
4. Export data using the "Export Data" button

### Interpreting Metrics

#### Performance Indicators
- **Green Zone**: MTTR < 4 hours, FCR > 80%, SLA Compliance > 95%
- **Yellow Zone**: MTTR 4-8 hours, FCR 60-80%, SLA Compliance 85-95%
- **Red Zone**: MTTR > 8 hours, FCR < 60%, SLA Compliance < 85%

#### Trend Analysis
- **Increasing Trend**: May indicate system issues or increased workload
- **Decreasing Trend**: May indicate improved processes or reduced incidents
- **Spikes**: May indicate specific events or system failures

### Best Practices
1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check dashboard daily for trends
2. **SLA Tracking**: Monitor SLA compliance rates closely
3. **Team Performance**: Use group metrics for performance reviews
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Use categorization data for problem identification
5. **Capacity Planning**: Use trend data for resource planning

## Customization

### Adding New Metrics
To add new metrics, update the `RemedyMetrics` interface and calculation function:

```typescript
interface RemedyMetrics {
  // ... existing metrics
  newMetric: number;
}

const calculateRemedyMetrics = (tickets: any[]): RemedyMetrics => {
  // ... existing calculations
  const newMetric = calculateNewMetric(tickets);
  
  return {
    // ... existing returns
    newMetric
  };
};
```

### Customizing Charts
Charts can be customized by modifying the Recharts components:

```typescript
<BarChart data={metrics.newMetric}>
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
  <XAxis dataKey="category" />
  <YAxis />
  <Tooltip />
  <Bar dataKey="value" fill="#customColor" />
</BarChart>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Data Displayed**: Check if uploaded_tickets table has data
2. **Filter Not Working**: Verify filter parameters and database connections
3. **Slow Performance**: Consider adding database indexes for large datasets
4. **Export Failures**: Check browser permissions and file size limits

### Performance Optimization
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Implement data caching for large datasets
- Use pagination for extensive data exports
- Optimize chart rendering for large datasets

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard updates
2. **Advanced Filtering**: More granular filter options
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Incident prediction models
4. **Automated Alerts**: Threshold-based notifications
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience
6. **Integration APIs**: Connect with other ITSM tools

### Custom Metrics
- **Customer Satisfaction Scores**
- **Cost per Incident**
- **Knowledge Base Usage**
- **Automation Impact**
- **Seasonal Trends**
